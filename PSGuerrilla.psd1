            ReleaseNotes = 'v2.10.7 (patch): (1) Spectre.Console console rendering restored — when PwshSpectreConsole is installed the bar charts and tables were calling Spectre.Console C# extension methods as instance methods ($chart.AddItem, $table.AddRow, $table.BorderColor, $tree.AddNode), which PowerShell cannot do, so every non-Quiet scan spammed "does not contain a method named …" and the chart/table/tree rendered blank. They now use the correct static extension classes (BarChartExtensions::AddItem, TableExtensions::AddRow, HasTreeNodeExtensions::AddNode) and set the border via BorderStyle, so the category bar charts, Findings-by-severity chart, and Priority-findings table render again; each enhanced renderer also falls back to the text renderer on error so a future Spectre API change degrades gracefully. (2) Test mode now uses a zeroed report-filename timestamp (…_report_00000000_000000.… / …-00000000-000000.…) so demo/sample output is fully deterministic, completing the test-mode determinism from v2.10.5 (real scans keep the real timestamp). v2.10.6 (docs): Endpoint-protection guidance + a Graph scope. README now documents — prominently in Requirements + a Troubleshooting section — that Microsoft Defender / EDR can false-positive on PSGuerrilla''s AD attack-detection files and block read access, so Import-Module fails with "Access to the path …Invoke-ADAclDelegationChecks.ps1 is denied"; fix is a Defender path exclusion (Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath) or a Protection-history Allow. This is the most common first-run failure on a hardened host. Also added AppCatalog.Read.All to the documented Entra app scopes (Teams app-catalog collection), plus Troubleshooting entries for the Teams 403 and the "No accessible Azure subscriptions" SKIP. Surfaced by the v2.10.4 live validation. v2.10.5 (patch): Test mode renders deterministic (zeroed) timestamps. With -TestMode (or the GUI "Test mode" checkbox) all console timestamps read 00:00 / 00:00:00 instead of the live clock, so demo/sample/screenshot output is stable — the operation header shows "0000 UTC" (date kept real), Write-ProgressLine shows "[0000 UTC]", and the GUI Operations log prefixes each line with "[00:00:00]". Driven by a self-healing module flag the audit cmdlets set per run (a real run resets it). Report filenames keep the real timestamp (zeroing would collide). v2.10.4 (patch): Backlog sweep — code-only gaps that don''t need a live tenant/DC. (GUI-1) The Safehouse tab "Add Credential" button now opens a real dark-themed WPF dialog (not a redirect-to-terminal stub) that stores Microsoft Entra/Graph (tenant/client/secret + optional expiry) or Google Workspace (service-account JSON via file picker + delegated-admin email) credentials straight into the vault and refreshes the grid, with GUID/email/SA-JSON validation before any write (non-interactive Save-SafehouseCredentialSet; builder/validator unit-tested; window render-verified). (ENT-5) Azure IAM checks now distinguish "no ARM access / no accessible subscriptions" — a single clear SKIP pointing at "grant the app Reader at the root management group" — from "no resources of this type found" (WARN, only when subscriptions exist). Previously every AZIAM check emitted a misleading "No X found in scanned subscriptions" WARN even with zero Azure access. (ENT-4 partial) Invoke-Infiltration collapses the ~40 individual "workload module not connected" SKIP lines into one pre-flight banner (EXO/Teams/SharePoint/Power Platform); net-new workload checks still need live validation. (DSInternals) One pre-flight note that the 5 password-hash checks (ADPWD-010..014) will SKIP, instead of five identical lines. Regression tests: verify-ent5-azure-skip.ps1 (7/7), verify-gui-credential-entry.ps1 (15/15); check counts unchanged (204/98/158). v2.10.3 (patch): Fixes from the v2.10.1 attack-path validation + the v2.10.2 GUI re-check. (1) ADPATH-001 false positives eliminated — the attack-path engine was reporting default infrastructure/admin principals (Domain Controllers group, Enterprise Domain Controllers, RODCs, Enterprise Read-only DCs, Schema Admins) as Tier-0 escalation paths even though they hold replication/control rights by AD design. A centralized allowlist (Test-DefaultControlPrincipal, matched by forge-proof well-known SID/RID, not locale-dependent names) now excludes them; in the reporter''s live domain this drops the headline from "32 paths, all non-privileged" to the ~7 genuine ones. (2) SourceIsPrivileged is now correct (was always false, so the highest-risk sort/count was meaningless) — true for default privileged principals incl. operator groups and Tier-0 members. (3) Azure AD Connect MSOL_* sync accounts have real DCSync rights but by design (tracked by ADTIER-001); they''re now flagged Expected, kept out of the non-privileged count, and reported separately rather than as surprise escalations. (4) DCSync/ACL-delegation checks share the same allowlist — Test-SafeAdminSid (ADPRIV-028, ADACL-010/015/016) delegates to Test-DefaultControlPrincipal (a strict superset of its old list), closing the residual where Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers (498) was reported as a non-default DCSync principal. (5) GUI-2 ComboBox selection box fixed for real — the closed box rendered with the system''s light button chrome (the nested ToggleButton''s TemplateBinding bound to its own unset Background, not the ComboBox''s), so near-white selection text read as blank/faint; the box fill is now hardcoded dark, verified by rendering the control off-screen to a bitmap and inspecting pixels. Regression tests added (Tests/verify-adpath-fix.ps1, 19/19). v2.10.2 (patch): GUI + safehouse audit fixes from the live GUI validation. (SH-1) Set-Safehouse -ConfigFile now also persists the Google Workspace delegated-admin email (and the Pushover/Twilio providers, previously dropped) into the vault — before this, a config-file setup followed by a vault-only scan (GUI / scheduled patrol, no -ConfigFile) failed with "AdminEmail is required." (SH-2) Get-Safehouse, Set-Safehouse -Status and the GUI Safehouse tab now reconcile vault metadata with the REAL secret store (Get-SecretInfo), so present-but-unregistered secrets (admin email, Pushover, legacy keys) are no longer hidden — a "are my creds loaded?" blind spot. (SH-3) Status now plainly discloses the no-master-password unattended mode instead of just labeling it "DPAPI". (GUI-1) The Safehouse "Test All" button now runs the real Test-Safehouse connectivity engine asynchronously and shows per-check results, instead of redirecting to the terminal. (GUI-2) ComboBoxes (Report style / Profile / Min alert level) now show their selected value when collapsed — a full dark control template themes the selection box. (GUI-4) A single-instance guard stops a second GUI window from clobbering shared config/state. (GUI-5) Rotate/Remove with no row selected now prompts to pick one. Regression tests added (Tests/verify-safehouse-fixes.ps1, 10/10). v2.10.1: Attack-path analysis now also flags GROUP-NESTING pivots — ADPATH-001 reports non-default groups nested inside a Tier-0 group (Domain/Enterprise/Schema Admins, Administrators, operator groups) as escalation pivots (controlling such a group, or being added to it, confers the Tier-0 group''s privileges). Uses the already-collected recursive privileged-group membership; well-known Tier-0 groups are excluded so only custom nesting is flagged. Each path now carries a PathType (Object control / Group nesting). v2.10.0: AD attack-path analysis. Invoke-Reconnaissance gains a new "AttackPath" category (check ADPATH-001) that turns the flat dangerous-ACL findings into named privilege-escalation PATHS to Tier-0, each annotated with the concrete takeover technique it enables. v1 models the highest-value edge class — non-default control (GenericAll/WriteDacl/WriteOwner/replication rights) over a Tier-0 object (the domain root, AdminSDHolder, the Domain Controllers OU, the GPO/Configuration/Schema containers), a one-hop path to Domain Admin equivalence — and surfaces paths from genuinely non-privileged principals first as the highest risk. Built on already-collected ACL + privileged-group data (no new collection); runs under -Categories All or ACLDelegation/AttackPath. AD coverage is now 204 checks across 15 categories. This is the first increment of the roadmap''s graph-based attack-path gap; full domain-wide TRANSITIVE path computation (low-priv user through nested-group control to Domain Admins) needs a full-domain ACL collector and is the next step. Regression tests added. v2.9.4 (patch): Fixes from the v2.9.3 live re-validation. (MON-4, regression) Continuous monitoring broke after the first run — Invoke-Surveillance/Invoke-Wiretap succeeded once then threw "Item has already been added" on every subsequent run (silently killing Register-Patrol scheduled monitoring). The scan-history append used `@($state.scanHistory) += @{...}`, which merged hashtable keys once a prior single-entry history reloaded from JSON. Both now build history via a new List-based Add-ScanHistoryEntry helper that always returns a clean array; two-run regression test added. (AD-1b) ADPRIV-028 (DCSync rights) reported instead of always SKIPping: with AD-1 collecting the domain-root DACL, the collector now derives DCSyncAccounts from the dangerous-ACE set (replication GUIDs 1131f6aa/1131f6ad/89e95b76, dropping default Tier-0 principals), completing the DCSync attack-path coverage. (GWS-3, partial) New Invoke-Fortification -Quick skips the slow per-user Gmail crawl (~1.4s/user; ~11min for 500 users) — directory/DNS/OAuth still run, Gmail-dependent EMAIL checks SKIP. Full parallelization deferred (needs live-tenant validation of runspace/token handling). See CHANGELOG.md for v2.9.3 and earlier.'
