function Get-NotAssessedFinding {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Returns a SKIP ("Not Assessed") finding when the data a check depends on
        failed to collect — so absence of evidence is never scored as PASS.
    .DESCRIPTION
        A check must call this BEFORE it returns a PASS-on-empty verdict. If a
        collector recorded a failure for any of the named source keys (i.e. the
        data was never successfully gathered), an empty result is indistinguishable
        from a genuinely clean tenant — and scoring it PASS manufactures false
        confidence. In that case this returns a SKIP finding, which the posture
        scorer (Get-AuditPostureScore) excludes from the score entirely rather than
        crediting as 100.

        Returns $null when none of the named sources failed — meaning the data WAS
        collected and an empty result is a legitimate PASS the caller can proceed to.

        Collector failures are recorded in a hashtable Errors map keyed by source
        name (e.g. $AuditData.Errors['TrustRelationships'], or a nested
        $AuditData.Federation.Errors['Domains']). Pass every Errors map that could
        carry the dependency. Non-hashtable Errors (a few AD sub-collectors use an
        array of strings for fine-grained partial failures) are ignored here.
    .EXAMPLE
        $na = Get-NotAssessedFinding -CheckDefinition $CheckDefinition `
            -ErrorMap $AuditData.Errors -SourceKey 'TrustRelationships' `
            -Subject 'trust relationships'
        if ($na) { return $na }
        # ... safe to treat an empty $AuditData.Trusts as a real PASS below ...
