    .SYNOPSIS
        Computes the composite Guerrilla Security Score (0-100).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Calculates a weighted composite score from three components:
          - Posture (70%): Audit posture scores from AD, Entra, and GWS findings
          - Coverage (15%): Percentage of the three assessment platforms with findings
          - Trend (15%): Score delta from previous run (improving = bonus)

        The retired Threats component scored monitoring detections; with the
        monitoring subsystem removed, keeping it would have silently awarded
        full credit for threats never assessed. Nothing in this score reflects
        data that was not collected.
    .PARAMETER AuditFindings
        Array of audit finding objects (from the AD, Entra, and GWS audits).
    .PARAMETER PreviousScore
        Previous Guerrilla Score for trend calculation. If not provided, trend is neutral.
    .PARAMETER Profile
        Baseline profile hashtable with component weights. Uses default weights if not provided.
